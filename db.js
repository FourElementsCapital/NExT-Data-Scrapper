    full_text: '\n        The new indices will be based on ores with manganese ore content of 37% and 44%, respectively.<br>\n<br>\nBased on market feedback after a one-month consultation period, Fastmarkets will launch the new indices to better reflect conditions in the Chinese market. China is the world’s biggest buyer of manganese ore globally, and currently accounts for 60-70% of all seaborne trades.<br>\n<br>\nWhile the global supply of manganese ore has increased, China retains its position as the biggest consumer, to meet demand from its new and upcoming ferro-alloy smelters. As a result, manganese ore trading in the Chinese domestic markets has also surged, intensifying the liquidity in Chinese manganese ore port prices, making them more reactive to changes in demand and supply.<br>\n<br>\nDomestic Chinese port indices for manganese ores will complement Fastmarkets’ existing manganese ore indices for 37% and 44% Mn, cif Tianjin.<br>\n<br>\nThese four indices will provide market participants with a comprehensive view of both the domestic Chinese market and the China-bound seaborne manganese ore market.<br>\n<br>\nBased on feedback to the proposal dated December 5, 2018, the specifications for the 37% manganese ore China port index will be:<br>\n<br>\nPrice: 37% Manganese ore China port index<br>\nManganese: Base 37%, Range 35-39%<br>\nIron: Base 5%, Maximum 10%<br>\nSilica: Base 5.5%, Maximum 12%<br>\nPhosphorus: Base 0.025%, Maximum 0.16%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> </strong><br>\nAlumina: Base 0.2%, Maximum 2%<br>\nMoisture: Base 4%, Maximum 12%<br>\nUnit: Yuan per dry metric tonne unit (dmtu)<br>\nGranularity: 5.5-75.0mm<br>\nForm: Lump<br>\nQuantity: Minimum 1,000 tonnes<br>\nPayment method: Cash or equivalent<br>\nDelivery port: Tianjin - normalized for any Chinese mainland sea port<br>\nDelivery window: Immediate<br>\nPublication: Weekly, Friday, 3pm London time<br>\n<br>\nBased on feedback to the proposal dated December 5, 2018, the specifications for the 44% manganese ore China port index will be:<br>\n<br>\nPrice: 44% Manganese ore China port index<br>\nManganese: Base 44%, Range 42-48%<br>\nIron: Base 5%, Maximum 16%<br>\nSilica: Base 11%, Maximum 12%<br>\nPhosphorus: Base 0.10%, Maximum 0.16%<br>\nAlumina: Base 5%, Maximum 14%<br>\nMoisture: Base 4%, Maximum 12%<br>\nUnit: Yuan per dry metric tonne unit (dmtu)<br>\nGranularity: 5.5-75.0mm<br>\nForm: Lump<br>\nQuantity: Minimum 1,000 tonnes<br>\nPayment method: Cash or equivalent<br>\nDelivery port: Tianjin - normalized for any Chinese mainland sea port<br>\nDelivery window: Immediate<br>\nPublication: Weekly, Friday, 3pm London time.<br>\n<br>\nThese indices have similar specifications to those for cif material to facilitate price comparisons among them.<br>\n<br>\nFastmarkets’ index methodology screens outliers and applies a quantity weighted model and a balanced weighting between market sides to ensure that the manganese ore China port indices are the most robust in the industry.<br>\n<br>\nFastmarkets has no financial interest in the level or direction of the index.<br>\n<br>\nTo provide feedback on these manganese ore China port indices, or if you would like to provide price information by becoming a data submitter to these indices, please contact Karen Ng by email at: pricing@fastmarkets.com.

    author: 'Jethro Wookey',

    full_text: '\n        The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3852483/Search-results/EC-proposes-country-specific-quartile-quotas-combination-for-definitive-measure-in-safeguard-case.html" target="_blank">EC proposal for new import quotas for steel products in Europe</a> has finally offered some clarity on what form those quotas will take in 2019, but the US government shutdown has added a new layer of political confusion and, in such an environment, it is unlikely that buyers will commit to any long-term business in the early part of the year. <br>\n<br>\nDecember was a quiet month for the European long steel market, with uncertainty over the import quotas and steadily weakening prices keeping buying activity at bay.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nAnd many suppliers were unwilling to&nbsp;sell at lower levels at a time when&nbsp;raw materials costs&nbsp;were rising, there was a forecast of strong demand&nbsp;and other&nbsp;influencing factors, such as low water levels on the Rhine and industrial action at some southern European ports, were&nbsp;disrupting deliveries. <br>\n<br>\nSo with little activity to speak of, prices stagnated through the month. <br>\n<br>\nDomestic rebar prices in Northern&nbsp;Europe stayed at €540-560 ($618-641) per tonne delivered throughout December, while in Southern Europe, prices edged down to €520-540 per tonne from €530-540. <br>\n<br>\nImport prices were also flat in the north, at €500-505 per tonne fob, while falling slightly in the south, to €470-500 per tonne from €480-510. <br>\n<br>\nIn the wire rod market prices were equally static. Domestic wire rod prices stayed at €540-560 per tonne delivered throughout December in both the north and south of Europe, while import prices were also flat through the month at €520-530 per tonne fob in both regions <br>\n<br>\nThe import quotas, introduced in mid 2018 to combat the market disruption caused by the US Section&nbsp;232 import tariffs, were based on an average of the previous three years of imports. But in a market where imports have been growing swiftly in recent years the volumes under the quotas were not&nbsp;regarded as sufficient. <br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, with just one quota covering all importing regions and&nbsp;a single figure for the whole applicable time period, the quota&nbsp;was seen by many as a rather too heavy-handed response to the issue at hand. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, the EC has now proposed an outline for the new quotas, to take effect when the old ones expire at the beginning of February. <br>\n<br>\nThe proposal not only adds 5% on top of the three-year average for calculating its volume, but is also country-specific for the major supplying regions, and will be imposed on a quarterly basis, with unused quarterly allocations&nbsp;automatically transferred to the next period. <br>\n<br>\nWhile EU-based producers are broadly positive&nbsp;about the new proposal,&nbsp;some aspects&nbsp;remain unclear. <br>\n<br>\nFor example, there is uncertainty over what happens to any accumulated volumes not used in each quarter, while the named regions that have their own quota volumes have, as yet, no quarterly breakdown&nbsp;- unlike&nbsp;the&nbsp;non-major supplying regions. <br>\n<br>\n“The proposal doesn’t fully meet our expectations,”&nbsp;one producer said. “What you need to maintain the equilibrium is a steady flow of business, not the peaks and troughs that we’ve been seeing.” <br>\n<br>\nWithout more clarity on those and other issues, the trend of volatile markets of varying activity will continue. <br>\n<br>\nWith much of the uncertainty over the import quotas nevertheless now removed, January could see buying activity increase as both buyers and sellers are able to plan further ahead with greater certainty over the import situation. <br>\n<br>\nBut there is still the question of the political environment. <br>\n<br>\nWhile many market participants were confident early in December that the US Section 232 tariffs would soon be relaxed for certain suppliers, President Donald&nbsp;Trump’s decision to shut down the government over funding for his border wall with Mexico means&nbsp;there will not be any movement on the tariffs for some time. <br>\n<br>\nAnd Trump has already said he is&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;let the shutdown drag on for months&nbsp;or even years. <br>\n<br>\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the chaos surrounding the United Kingdom\'s impending exit from the European Union (\'Brexit\') will continue to add to the political uncertainty. <br>\n<br>\nThe EC quota proposal may have granted the market enough clarity for buyers to start stocking up again, but the political uncertainty is&nbsp;likely to limit that activity to the relative near term. <br>\n<br>\nAnd it will be very difficult for sellers to significantly raise prices in January while buyers keep to this strategy.<br>\n<br>\n<img alt="" src="/Images/656/99865/EU-long-steel-output-080119.jpg">\n    '
